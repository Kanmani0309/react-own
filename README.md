# README: React Responsive Admin Dashboard

## Overview

This is a **Responsive Admin Dashboard** built with **React JS** as a practice project to enhance my frontend development skills. The project includes reusable components like a `Header`, `Navbar` (replacing the previous `Sidebar`), and a `Home` section that features interactive cards and charts. The dashboard is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Navbar:**  
  A responsive Navbar for easy navigation with menu toggling on smaller screens.

- **Interactive Cards:**  
  Summary cards display key statistics such as products, categories, customers, and alerts.

- **Charts Integration:**  
  Includes a Bar Chart and a Line Chart for data visualization, powered by the `recharts` library.

  Adjusts layout and components to fit screens of all sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

- **Reusable Components:**  
  Modular design with components like `Header`, `Navbar`, and `Home`.
